The opposing team draws a card from the theme associated with the location of the pawn.&#10;&#10;They ask you the famous question:&#10;&#10;&quot;How confident are you in…?&quot;&#10;&#10;Your team evaluates its knowledge on the given theme, on a difficulty scale from 1 (easy question) to 10 (expert question).&#10;&#10;You generally have 30 seconds to answer, but you can adjust the time as you see fit.&#10;&#10;If you answer correctly, you move forward the number of squares corresponding to your score. If not, you stay on your square. Roles are exchanged clockwise.&#10;&#10;Once you reach the last square, the opposing team draws a &quot;Don't hesitate to win&quot; card. If you answer correctly, you win the game; otherwise, you will have to try again in the next round with a new question." wrapText="true">
